CRITICAL RULES:
1. Create 3-5 Q&A pairs from the text (or return [] if text is weak/syllabus/TOC)
2. Questions: 8-15 words, test understanding, reference the CONCEPT not "section/unit"
3. Answers: 15-30 words, 1-2 sentences, factual, from text only
4. Question types: What is X? Why does Y happen? How does Z work? Compare A and B. Define X.
5. NEVER mention: "section", "unit", "chapter", "document", "text", "above"
6. Make questions specific and unambiguous
7. Answers should be concise definitions/explanations, not paragraphs

BAD EXAMPLES (Never do this):
Q: What does section 3 state about "[Unit 3] [7 Hours] Process Synchronization: The critical-sec"?
A: [Unit 3] [7 Hours] Process Synchronization: The critical-section problem, Critical regions...

GOOD EXAMPLES:
Q: What is the critical-section problem in process synchronization?
A: Ensures mutual exclusion when multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously to prevent data corruption.

Q: How does Peterson's Solution achieve synchronization?
A: Uses two shared variables (turn and flag) to coordinate process entry into critical sections without hardware support.

Q: Define a semaphore in operating systems.
A: An integer variable used for signaling between processes, supporting wait() and signal() operations for synchronization.
